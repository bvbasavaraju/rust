# Rust
For Rust based programming and practice.

Not came to a point where I can define the coding guidelines yet!, I am very new to Rust, but not for programming. So, hoping to define the guidelines for contriutors. meanwhile if you are interested in contribution, please feel free to do the same but, if possible define the guidelines.

even I can't find the guidelines from Google!!

Till the guidelines are defined, please make sure to use atleast the C++ based guidelines as much as possible.
